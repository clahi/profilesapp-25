# Basic web application

# Overview

AWS Amplify offers a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with backends. When connected to a Git repository, Amplify determines the build settings for both the frontend framework and any configured backend resources, and automatically deploys updates with every code commit.

## Serverless Function

## Overview

Now that we have a React web app, we will use AWS Amplify and AWS Lambda to configure a serverless function. This function is invoked after a signed-up user confirms their user account. AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources, making it the fastest way to turn an idea into a modern, production, serverless applications.
